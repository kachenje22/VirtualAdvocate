                            <p>Virtual Advocate is widely used as a first-draft generator enabling law firm partners, associates and paralegals to rapidly and accurately draft subsequent client documents.</p>
                            <p>By generating everything from simple single-page letters to complex contracts in a fraction of the time it would take to do it the old, cut-and-paste way with much greater accuracy- reduced efforts and costs associated with document drafting result in drastically increased partner profits.</p>
                            <p>Virtual Advocate not only increases partner profitability but it also helps win new clients and retain existing clients by making possible the compelling combination of better service at lower costs.</p>
